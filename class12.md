## Chart.js and Canvas API
* Chart.js is a JavaScript plugin that uses HTML5’s canvas element to draw the graph onto the page. It’s a well documented plugin that makes using all kinds of bar charts, line charts, pie charts and more, incredibly easy.
* At first sight a \<canvas\> looks like the \<img\> element, with the only clear difference being that it doesn't have the src and alt attributes. Indeed, the \<canvas\> element has only two attributes, width and height. These are both optional and can also be set using DOM properties. When no width and height attributes are specified, the canvas will initially be 300 pixels wide and 150 pixels high. The element can be sized arbitrarily by CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size: if the CSS sizing doesn't respect the ratio of the initial canvas, it will appear distorted.
* The \<canvas\> element can be styled just like any normal image (margin, border, background…). These rules, however, don't affect the actual drawing on the canvas.
* The \<canvas\> element differs from an \<img\> tag in that, like for \<video\>, \<audio\>, or \<picture\> elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it, The \<canvas\> element differs from an \<img\> tag in that, like for \<video\>, \<audio\>, or \<picture\> elements, it is easy to define some fallback content, to be displayed in older browsers not supporting it.
* The \<canvas\> element creates a fixed-size drawing surface that exposes one or more rendering contexts, which are used to create and manipulate the content shown. In this tutorial, we focus on the 2D rendering context. Other contexts may provide different types of rendering.
