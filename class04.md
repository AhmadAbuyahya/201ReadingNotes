## Links
* Links are created using the \<a> element. Users can click on anything
between the opening \<a> tag and the closing \</a> tag. You specify
which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
* If you want a link to open in a
new window, you can use the
target attribute on the opening
\<a> tag. The value of this
attribute should be _blank.
* If you are linking to a page within your own site, it is
best to use relative links rather than qualified URLs.
* You can use the id attribute to target elements within
a page that can be linked to.

## Layout
* Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:
\<h1> \<p> \<ul> \<li>.
* Inline elements
flow in between
surrounding text
Examples include:
\<img> \<b> \<i>.
* If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.
* You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.

## Functions
* A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
* Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
* The code inside the function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function.
* Objects are variables that can contain many values.
This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to a variable named car:
var car = {type:"Fiat", model:"500", color:"white"};.
