## Layout
* Block-level elements
start on a new line
Examples include:
\<h1> \<p> \<ul> \<li>.
* Inline elements
flow in between
surrounding text
Examples include:
\<img> \<b> \<i>.
* If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.
* You specify the positioning scheme using the position
property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
