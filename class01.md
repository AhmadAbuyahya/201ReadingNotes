## Strcture
* HTML uses tags to give the information they surround special meaning.
* Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
* <h1> to <h6> tags are for headers.
* <p> tag is for paragraphs.
* Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
* Attributes require a name and a value.
## Extra Markup
* DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using.
* The id and class attributes allow you to identify particular elements.
* The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group block-level and inline elements together.
* Escape characters are used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©.
## HTML5 Layout
* The new HTML5 elements i XX ndicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure.
* The <header> and <footer> elements can be used for the main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
* The <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
* The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.
* The <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.
* The purpose of the <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading.
## Process & Design
* It's important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.
* Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
* Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
* Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
* You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
* You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
