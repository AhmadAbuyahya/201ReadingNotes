## **Text**
* HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
* They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).
* Tags from h1 to h6 are for different headings.
* P tag is for paragraphs.
* B tag is for bold text and i is for italic
* sup tag is for superscript
* sub tag is subscript.

## Introducing CSS
* CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that element should look.
* Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
* There are universal selectors, class selectors, id selectors and element selectors.
* Declarations are made up of two parts:
1. the properties of the element that you want to change, and 
2. the values of those properties. 
For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

## Basic JavaScript Instructions
* A script is a series of statements that contain very percise intructions.
* Variables are used to store pieces of info temporarily.
* Arrays are special variables to store multiple pieces of info related to each other.
* Expressions evaluate into a single value.
* Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.

## Decisions and Loops
* Comparison operators (<, >, =, etc. ) are used to compare two operands.
* Logical operators (or, and, etc) are used to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
