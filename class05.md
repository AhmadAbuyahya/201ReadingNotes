## Images
* To add an image into the page
you need to use an \<img\>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
    * src
     This tells the browser where
      it can find the image file.
    * alt
    This provides a text description of the image which describes the image if you cannot see it.
* height and width attributes specify the height and width of the image in pixels.    

## Color
How to specify a color in CSS?
There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:

RGB values: Values for red, green, and blue are expressed as numbers between 0 and 255.
Hex Codes: Hex values represent values for red, green, and blue in hexadecimal code.
HSL colors: stands for Hue, Saturation and Brightness.
Color Names: Colors are represented by predefined names. However, they are very limited in number.
Opacity
CSS3 introduces the opacity property which allows you to specify the opacity of an element and any of its child elements. The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0.

The CSS3 rgba property allows you to specify a color, just like you would with an RGB value, but adds a fourth value to indicate opacity.

## Text
* There are properties to control the choice of font, size,
weight, style, and spacing.
* There is a limited choice of fonts that you can assume
most people will have installed.
* If you want to use a wider range of typefaces there are
several options, but you need to have the right license
to use them.
* You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.
* You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
