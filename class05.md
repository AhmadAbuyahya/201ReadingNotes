## Images
* To add an image into the page
you need to use an \<\img\>
element. This is an empty
element (which means there is
no closing tag). It must carry the
following two attributes:
src
This tells the browser where
it can find the image file. This
will usually be a relative URL
pointing to an image on your
own site. (Here you can see that
the images are in a child folder
called images â€” relative URLs
were covered on pages 83-84).
