# Javascript Debugging
* Debugging is the process of finding errors.
* Execution context (EC) is defined as the environment in which the JavaScript code is executed. By environment, I mean the value of this , variables, objects, and functions JavaScript code has access to at a particular time.
* Stack is a very useful data structure and has a wide range of application. Stack is a linear data structure in which addition or removal of element follows a particular order.
* If you understand execution context and stacks you are more likely to find errors.
* The console helps narrow down the area of the error.
* Error objects are thrown when runtime errors occur. The Error object can also be used as a base object for user-defined exceptions.
* built-in error types:
  * EvalError.
  * RangeError.
  * ReferenceError.
  * SyntaxError.
  * TypeError.
  * URIError.
  * AggregateError.
  * InternalError.
* If you know that you may get an error, you can handle it using the try, catch, finally statements. Use them to give your users helpful feedback.
